## This is the second iteration of this project
The first one is fubar

## The book is C++20 for Programmers 3rd edition Paul and Harvey Deitel

## Issues overcame first example program
I learned about correct locations to place things in MS VS 2019
Paul graciously responded to my email and pointed me to correct resources
I was able to build and compile this simple program that was writen by the author
I also learned that in windows 10 shift + right click gives the ability to copy to path
I also completed this task in Linux, and Docker desktop.
I created an ec2 image of debian and attempted to upgrade the gnu compiler to 10, 
however I was not able to complete the task. My version of gcc in Debian buster is 8.3.
For the docker desktop I pulled down a gcc image.
  I did not like that there was no tab completion in the docker image.
